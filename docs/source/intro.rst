1. Introduction
===============

The past 50 years have seen a lot of computing ideas come and go. This evolution of computing, just as in biology, has seen a lot of extinctions with some clear winners emerging.


The major operating systems we use today are only different enough to distinguish ownership. Don't believe me? Ask yourself how many times in the past 20 years have you picked an OS because you needed a unique OS feature - you need to be a systems programmer with a narrow use case to be able to say anything other than 0. Now how many times did you make that choice based on the applications you want to run, or the licensing requirements, or the privacy protections?

Some 6502 projects act as memorials, allowing us to bask in nostalgia. The Picocomputer 6502 instead props up our beloved processor with the winning ideas. Modern peripherals and modern development tools make it a pleasure to use. The opinionated design is easy to override so it won't resist experimenting with older peripherals and tools.
