RP6502-RFC
##########


Contributing
============

Start by reading this: https://docs.kernel.org/process/3.Early-stage.html

RP6502 main is only accepting 1.0-ready code. If your feature isn't ready to be merged with main and you need feedback, post your RFC on the forums and optionally here in the documentation. If you have code you want tested by a wide audience, create a release on your fork, e.g."0.1+foo1".

The bar for the kernel is extremely high. It's there so I can get to 1.0 and not be supporting a dumpster fire. Other areas of this project have a much lower bar. In fact, everything else is set to just above spam. If you see a bug or typo, send it in. If your OCD rages on my grammar, send it all in. If you want to create documentation, be a hero.
