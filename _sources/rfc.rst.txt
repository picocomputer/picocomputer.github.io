RP6502-RFC
##########


Contributing
============

Start by reading this: https://docs.kernel.org/process/3.Early-stage.html

RP6502 main is only accepting 1.0-ready code. If your feature isn't ready to be merged with main and you need feedback, post your RFC on the forums and optionally here in the documentation. If you have code you want tested by a wide audience, create a release on your fork, e.g."0.1+foo1".

Deciding what features are ready for main is done simply by asking myself how much future maintenance something will need. For example, localization options shouldn't need a binary release to add a new or updated locale.

Other areas of this project have a much lower bar for acceptance. In fact, everything else is set to just above spam. If you see a bug or typo, send it in.
