=================

The Picocomputer explores retro computing and game development by removing the barrier between genuine 8-bit hardware and modern devices. This is the documentation.

The RP6502 chipset comes in two parts. The RP6502-RIA is an interface adapter that connects to a 6502 much like CIA, VIA, and ACIA devices. The RP6502-VGA is an optional video chip that connects to the RP6502-RIA. Both of these are simply Raspberry Pi Picos with the RP6502 firmware.
