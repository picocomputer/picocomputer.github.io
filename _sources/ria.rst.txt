RP6502 - RP6502 Interface Adapter


Introduction
============

The RP6502 Interface Adapter (RIA) is a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 with
:doc:`ria` firmware. The :doc:`ria` provides all essential services to
support a WDC W65C02S microprocessor.

The :doc:`ria` must be installed at $FFE0-$FFFF and must be in control of
RESB and PHI2. These are the only requirements. Everything else about
your Picocomputer can be customized. Even the :doc:`vga` is optional.

A new :doc:`ria` will boot to the RP6502 monitor which you can access from the
console. The console can be accessed in one of three ways: from a VGA
monitor and USB or Bluetooth keyboard if you are using an :doc:`vga`;
from the USB CDC device which the :doc:`vga` presents when plugged
into a host PC like a development system; or from UART RX/TX
(115200 8N1) pins on the RIA if you aren't using an :doc:`vga`. The
monitor is not documented here beyond highlighting some common
commands. The built-in help is extensive and always up-to-date. Type
``help`` to get started and don't forget there is deep help like
``help set phi2``.

The RP6502 monitor is not an operating system shell. It is analogous to a
UEFI shell. The RP6502 monitor is primarily designed to load ROMs.
It also has a small amount of hardware and locale
configuration, which is intentionally kept minimal.

Loading ROMs in .rp6502 format is done with the ``load``
command. Type ``help load`` to learn about the file format for ROMs.
These aren't ROMs in the traditional (obsolete) sense. A ROM is a file
that contains a memory image to be loaded in RAM before starting the
6502. The :doc:`ria` includes 1MB of EEPROM which you can ``install`` ROMs to.
Once a ROM is installed, you can run it directly or ``set boot`` so it
loads when the :doc:`ria` boots.

Some of the monitor commands, like ``upload`` and ``binary`` are
designed for use by developer tools. The rp6502.py script, included
with the examples and templates, can be used to automate packaging of a
ROM and executing it.


Reset
=====

It helps to think about reset as two states instead of a pulse on
RESB. When reset is low, the 6502 is stopped and the console is
connected to the RP6502 monitor. When reset is high, the 6502 is running
and the console is connected both stdio in the :doc:`os` and the UART TX/RX
registers described below.

If you want to move reset from low to high, either ``load`` a ROM with
a reset vector, or use the ``reset`` command if you have prepared RAM
some other way.

To move reset from high to low and return to the monitor, even with a
crashed or halted 6502, you have two options:

1. Using a Bluetooth or USB keyboard, press CTRL-ALT-DEL.
2. Send a break to the RIA UART.

WARNING! Do not hook up a physical button to RESB. The :doc:`ria` must remain
in control of RESB. What you probably want is the reset that happens
from the RIA RUN pin. We call this a ``reboot``. The reference hardware
reboot button is hooked up to the RIA RUN pin. Rebooting the :doc:`ria`
like this will cause any configured boot ROM to load, like at power
on. Resetting the 6502 from keyboard or UART will only return you to
the RP6502 console.

UART
----

Easy and direct access to the UART RX/TX pins of the :doc:`ria` is
available from $FFE0-$FFE2. The ready flags on bits 6-7 enable testing
with the BIT operator. You may choose to use these or stdio
from the :doc:`os`. Using the UART directly while a stdio
OS function is in progress will result in undefined behavior.
The UART hardware runs at 115200 bps, 8 bit words, no parity, 1 stop bit.

Extended RAM (XRAM)
-------------------

RW0 and RW1 are two portals to the same 64K XRAM. Having only one
portal would make moving XRAM very slow since data would have to
buffer in 6502 RAM. Ideally, you won't move XRAM and can use the pair
for better optimizations.

STEP0 and STEP1 are reset to 1. These are signed so you can go
backwards and reverse data. These adders allow for very fast sequential
access, which typically makes up for the slightly slower random access
compared to 6502 system RAM.

RW0 and RW1 are latching. This is important to remember when other
systems change XRAM. For example, when using read_xram() to load XRAM
from a mass storage device, this will not work as expected:

.. code-block:: C

  RIA.addr0 = 0x1000;
  read_xram(0x1000, 1, fd);
  uint8_t result = RIA.rw0; // wrong

Setting ADDR after the expected XRAM change will latch RW to the
latest value.

.. code-block:: C

  read_xram(0x1000, 1, fd);
  RIA.addr0 = 0x1000;
  uint8_t result = RIA.rw0; // correct

Extended Stack (XSTACK)
-----------------------

This is 512 bytes of last-in, first-out, top-down stack used for the
fastcall mechanism described in the :doc:`os`. Reading past the end
is guaranteed to return zeros. Simply write to push and read to pull.

Extended Registers (XREG)
-------------------------

The :doc:`RIA` is both the host of the PIX bus (documented below)
and device 0 on the PIX bus.

Pico Information Exchange (PIX)
===============================

The limited number of GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico required
creating a new bus for high bandwidth devices like video systems. This
is an addressable broadcast system which any number of devices can
listen to.

Physical layer
--------------

The physical layer is designed to be easily decoded by Pi Pico PIO,
which is just a fancy shift register. The signals used are PHI2 and
PIX0-3. This is a double data rate bus with PIX0-3 shifted left on
both transitions of PHI2. A frame consists of 32 bits transmitted over
4 cycles of PHI2.

Bit 28 (0x10000000) is the framing bit. This bit will be set in all
messages. An all-zero payload is repeated on device ID 7 when the bus
is idle. A receiver will synchronize by ensuring PIX0 is high on a low
transition of PHI2. If it is not, stall until the next clock cycle.

Bits 31-29 (0xE0000000) indicate the device ID number for a message.

Device 0 is allocated to :doc:`ria`. Device 0 is also overloaded to
broadcast XRAM.

Device 1 is allocated to :doc:`vga`.

Devices 2-6 are available for user expansion.

Device 7 is used for synchronization. Because 0xF0000000 is hard to
miss on test equipment.

Bits 27-24 (0x0F000000) indicate the channel ID number for a message.
Each device can have 16 channels.

Bits 23-16 (0x00FF0000) indicate the register address in the channel
on the device.

Bits 15-0 (0x0000FFFF) is a value to store in the register.

PIX Extended RAM (XRAM)
-----------------------

All changes to the 64KB of XRAM on the RIA will be broadcast to PIX
device 0. Bits 15-0 contain the XRAM address. Bits 23-16 contain the
XRAM data.

PIX devices will maintain a replica of the XRAM they use. Typically,
all 64K is replicated and an XREG set by a 6502 application will
install virtual hardware at a location in XRAM.

PIX Extended Registers (XREG)
-----------------------------

PIX devices may use bits 27-0 however they choose. The suggested
division of these bits is:

Bits 27-24 indicate a channel. For example, the RIA device has a
channel for audio, a channel for keyboard, a channel for mice, and so
on. Bits 23-16 contain an extended register address. Bits 15-0 contain
the value to be stored.

So we have seven PIX devices, each with 16 internal channels having 256
16-bit registers. The idea is to use these extended registers to
configure virtual hardware and map it into extended memory.


Keyboard
========

The RIA can provide direct access to keyboard data. This is intended
for applications that need to detect both key up and down events or the
modifier keys. You may instead use the UART or stdin if you don't need
this kind of direct access.

Enable and disable direct keyboard access by mapping it to an address
in XRAM.

.. code-block:: C

  xreg(0, 0, 0x00, xaddr);  // enable
  xreg(0, 0, 0x00, 0xFFFF); // disable
  xreg_ria_keyboard(xaddr); // macro shortcut

XRAM will be continuously updated with a bit array of USB HID
keyboard codes. Note that these are not the same as PS/2 scancodes.
Each bit represents one key with the first four bits/codes having special
meaning:

- 0 - No key pressed
- 1 - Num Lock on
- 2 - Caps Lock on
- 3 - Scroll Lock on

.. code-block:: C

  uint8_t keyboard[32];
  #define key(code) (keyboard[code >> 3] & \
                    (1 << (code & 7)))


Mouse
=====

The RIA can provide direct access to mouse information. Enable and
disable by mapping it to an address in XRAM.

.. code-block:: C

  xreg(0, 0, 0x01, xaddr);  // enable
  xreg(0, 0, 0x01, 0xFFFF); // disable
  xreg_ria_mouse(xaddr);    // macro shortcut

This sets the address in XRAM for a structure containing direct
mouse input.

.. code-block:: C

  struct {
      uint8_t buttons;
      uint8_t x;
      uint8_t y;
      uint8_t wheel;
      uint8_t pan;
  } mouse;

The amount of movement is computed by way of the application subtracting
the previous value from the current value. Vsync timing (60Hz) is period correct
but isn't fast enough by modern standards. For perfect mouse input, use an ISR
at 8ms or faster (125Hz).

It is recommended that applications consider the canvas resolution when
interpreting the movement. For 640x480 and 640x360 resolutions, each
unit of movement equates to one pixel. For 320x240 and 320x180
resolutions, use two units of movement for each pixel.

.. code-block:: C

  int8_t delta_x = current_x - prev_x;
  int8_t delta_y = current_y - prev_y;

Mouse buttons are a bitfield:

- 0 - LEFT
- 1 - RIGHT
- 2 - MIDDLE
- 3 - BACKWARD
- 4 - FORWARD


Gamepads
========

The :doc:`ria` supports up to four gamepads. There are drivers for Generic HID,
XInput, and Playstation controllers. Unfortunately, the TinyUSB stack
that the RIA uses is unstable on the Pi Pico and the information needed
to fix it is not part of the Pi Pico documentation. XInput is currently
disabled and you may find USB instability on other devices.

Some gamepads let you select between HID/DInput/Android, XInput, and
other systems. Choose HID/DInput/Android for the best chance of working.

Modern gamepads have all evolved to the same four face buttons, d-pad,
dual analog sticks, and quad shoulders. The minor variations of the four
face buttons are XY/AB, YX/BA, or Square/Triangle/Cross/Circle. This is
generally of no consequence to the application unless those buttons are
intended to represent a direction. In that case, the
Square/Triangle/Cross/Circle and XY/AB layouts are "the official" layout
of the RP6502. You can, of course, do your own thing and request players
use a specific gamepad or include a "AB or BA" option.

Enable and disable access to the RIA gamepad XRAM registers by setting
the extended register. The register value is the XRAM start address of
the gamepad data. Any invalid address disables the gamepads.

.. code-block:: C

  xreg(0, 0, 2, xaddr);    // enable
  xreg(0, 0, 2, 0xFFFF);   // disable
  xreg_ria_gamepad(xaddr); // macro shortcut

Extended memory will be continuously updated with gamepad information.
The 10-byte structure described here repeats for a total of 40 bytes
representing four gamepads.

The upper bits of the DPAD register are used to indicate if a gamepad is
ready for use and what kind of gamepad it is. The connected bit is high
when a gamepad for that player slot is connected. The Sony bit indicates
that the player is using a PlayStation-style gamepad with
Circle/Cross/Square/Triangle button faces.

Note that there are both digital and analog values for the left and
right analog sticks and analog triggers L2/R2. This lets an application
completely ignore the analog values if it desires.

Applications supporting L2 and R2 should be aware that some gamepads
will only present digital information so the analog values will only
ever be 0 or 255.

Applications that want to use a simple "one stick and buttons" approach
are encouraged to support both the dpad and left stick (merged).

Programmable Sound Generator
=============================

The RIA includes a Programmable Sound Generator (PSG). It is configured
with extended register device 0 channel 1 address 0x00.

* Eight 24kHz 8-bit oscillator channels.
* Five waveforms: Sine, Square, Sawtooth, Triangle, Noise.
* ADSR envelope: Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release.
* Stereo panning.
* PWM for all waveforms.

Each of the eight oscillators requires eight bytes of XRAM for
configuration. The unused byte is padding so multiplication is a fast
bit shift.

.. code-block:: C

  typedef struct
  {
      unsigned int freq;
      unsigned char duty;
      unsigned char vol_attack;
      unsigned char vol_decay;
      unsigned char wave_release;
      unsigned char pan_gate;
      unsigned char unused;
  } ria_psg_t;

Internally, the audio is generated by Pulse Width Modulation. A
decoupling and low-pass filter circuit converts the digital signal
into line-level analog.

Enable and disable the RIA PSG by setting the extended register. The
register value is the XRAM start address for the 64 bytes of config.
This start address must be int-aligned. Any invalid address disables
the PSG.

.. code-block:: C

  xreg(0, 1, 0x00, xaddr); // enable
  xreg(0, 1, 0x00, 0xFFFF); // disable

All configuration changes take effect immediately. This allows for
effects like panning, slide instruments, and other CPU-driven
shenanigans.

The gate is checked at the sample rate of 24kHz. If, for example, you
unset and set it between one pair of audio output samples, then it will
not begin a new ADSR cycle.
